Searching – Linear vs Binary Search on Product Data

✅ Description
Implements both linear and binary search algorithms on a product list (with `productId`, `name`, and `category`). Demonstrates search efficiency for e-commerce-style data.

📁 Files
- `Product.java`
- `Test.java` (Main with Scanner input)

📊 Time Complexity Comparison

| Search Type     | Best Case | Average Case | Worst Case |
|------------------|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| Linear Search    | O(1)      | O(n)          | O(n)        |
| Binary Search    | O(1)      | O(log n)      | O(log n)    |

> 🔸 **Binary search** is faster for large sorted datasets but requires sorting beforehand.  
> 🔸 **Linear search** is simple and works on unsorted lists but is inefficient for large inputs.

✅ Recommendation:
For real-time search systems (like e-commerce):
- Use **Binary Search** if data is frequently sorted and mostly read-only.
- Use **Hashing/Indexing** or **Search Trees** for large-scale dynamic data.
